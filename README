 * description
  ktm_poi - collection of tools that import filtered lists of KTM dealership/service locations and creates a csv that can be converted into a POI (points of interest) file - great for offline GPS devices

 * but why?
  well, bikes do break. and it's nice to be able to quickly find out where the closest friendly service is by just looking at the gps.

 * dependencies
   - a linux/bsd/cygwin environment with a C compiler, iconv, sed and curl
   - libjson-c

 * how to use the tool
  run `make`
  edit get_dealers.sh and select the countries you're interested in
  run `bash get_dealers.sh`
  import resulting file (tmp/europe.csv) into a conversion tool like POILoader
  save converted file to your GPS device

 * example output can be found here: https://github.com/rodan/ktm_poi/tree/master/result
 download by clicking on the ktm_eu.* file, right-click on 'Raw' and select 'Save link as ...'
 the two files provided contain all EU locations and can be directly used in a Garmin gps device.
