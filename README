 * description
  ktm_poi - collection of tools that import filtered lists of KTM dealership/service locations and creates a csv that can be converted into a POI (points of interest) file - great for offline GPS devices

 * but why?
  well, bikes do break. and it's nice to be able to quickly find out where the closest friendly service is by just looking at the gps.

 * dependencies
   - a linux/bsd/cygwin environment with a C compiler, iconv, sed and curl
   - libjson-c

 * how to use
  run `make`
  edit get_dealers.sh and select the countries you're interested in
  run `bash get_dealers.sh`
  import resulting file (tmp/europe.csv) into a conversion tool like POILoader
  save converted file to your GPS device
